# Web Application

The a web application that allows the user to CREATE READ UPDATE and DELETE Recipes and Ingredient entitites from a JDBC H2 database using an API built in Java interacting through
a front end developed using HTML CSS and JS, BootStrap was used for the CSS.
The program should be able to run from any browser when given the correct URL.
## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
To get a working copy of the most recent Web Application you can fork from the master branch, or you can download a copy of the master as a .zip file

### Prerequisites

If you don't have a browser you can download one of your choice. You will also need to download Spring to help with testing the back end.
Postman is an application you can use to test requests and ensure you are getting the correct data returned.

```
Give examples
```
Spring - Download link

PostMan - Download link

VSCODE - Download link

### Installing

Once the prerequisites are installed and you have forked or downloaded the zip, the program should run out of the box.
```
1. Open Eclipse or Spring and run the notesProject.java as a spring app.
```

```
2. Open VSCODE and run the index.html on a live server
```

```
3. The website will open up if the previous steps were followed.
```
```
You can now navigate the website and CREATE READ UPDATE and DELETE any entity as you please
```
The database is initialised as empty, so if you navigate to the add recipe page you will be able to add a recipe and you will instantly be taken back to th view all recipes page 
and see your input there.

## Running the tests

**Tests for Persistance**
There were no persistance tests because Lombok was used and that was tested before it was deployed.

**Tests for Controllers**

### Unit Tests 

These tests how well the Service and Controllers work by themselves if the system was running as "expected" hence unit testing, because it is testing seperate units of Code.
Navigate to the test folder and run any of the unit tests



### Integration Tests 
Intergration tests focus on how well parts of code work within the whole system
